## Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing
In a dataset of over 11,000 subscribers to a monthly weight loss program, is there a correlation between the number of visits and weight loss in pounds to subscribers continuing the monthly subscription.
From this analysis, we can also determine if a trend exists among patient subscribers who have canceled, suspended, or held subscriptions that can be directed to reduce inactive patient membership.

## Data Sets Used

Wellness facility data from 2018 to compare subscriber patient data on the following activities:
•	# of visits per month (for weigh in’s, boosters, or other consultation)
•	Starting weight at beginning of month
•	Ending weight at beginning of month
•	Start Date of Subscription
•	Subscription Status
•	Subscription Status Reasons (Medical hold, financial hold, etc.)
## ML

We plan to use a classification machine learning algorithm to group patients by visit count and weight loss to compare against those patients who have known status holds.

## Tech

Programs to be Used
1.	Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library
2.	Python Pandas
3.	MySQL Database
4.	Power Bi
5.	Others as needed


## Project Tasks
1.	Create Hypothesis for solving Problem
2.	Pull data from SQL Database
3.	Clean Data (hide and create alternative Patient ID for HIPAA compliance)
4.	Modify Data using Pandas
5.	Create Machine Learning Algorithm for training and testing of data
6.	Create visualization in Power Bi to determine data trends
7.	Review findings to answer HypothesisCreate and present findings to class on Saturday, February 2nd
